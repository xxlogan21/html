    This track was created by Logan 1/2 of TAOs last year, it was a track made along side with "3Am" which is a track with the Chill Minute Crew. <br> Although this track said it featured the Chill Minute Crew, but it was soley produced by Logan. The cover is art was also created by Logan, <br>it even inspired to make NFT figures LOL.

   This track was created by Jerry 2/2 of TAOs, the beginning of this year I beliebe. It was meant to be "Red" part 2, therefore both track contain similar style. <br>It is one of Logan's favorite track to Jam to late at night, cause it hits diff when the synthwave come in. The cover picture was a doodle made by Jerry from a few years back?<br> But it was dope, better then a random bird doodle we were planning on using. Apperanlty there was other "Beach house type beat" along side with this track, very rare.
